## System Architecture

## How to deploy this solution to your server?

You can use docker-compose for example:
```YAML
services:
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    image: "dulik65/deployment-center-frontend:202412150049"
  api:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    image: "dulik65/deployment-center-api:202412150049"
    environment:
    # optional
      OpenAI__Key: "..."
      OpenAI__Model: "gpt-4o"
```
`docker compose up` will start two containers, one with frontend app and second with API.

API application should be placed in the same subnet with cluster that you would like to connect to.
